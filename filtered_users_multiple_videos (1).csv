Something is not right Trump and Elon Musk had plenty of time to prepare since January 6. This is revenge to avoid prison, Elon wants to have a place in the White House. Elon has the finances, and the resources, and X was constantly promoting and supporting his and Trump&#39;s lies. This election was manipulated by X for sure. There won’t be another election.

@vachelmcfarland4886,"Let&#39;s be clear... The Dems did not really lose the election.  The Repubs had groups across the USA, esp., True the Vote, who actively worked to disenfranchise legal voters of color by a policy of establishing the right of any (usually white) voter to challenge any other voter&#39;s (usually POC) right to cast a ballot, including those in the military who may be serving out of state.  The accused could only be re-enfranchised if they showed up at their local voters office to show documents that they are legal Americans.<br>However, many challenged voters were not alerted that their status had been challenged and therefore their votes were invalidated.<br>True the Vote did this in 48 states across the country.  It is estimated that thousands upon thousands of votes were not counted giving Trump the very slight edge over Harris.<br><br>Why no one is covering this on left wing media is shameful.",Km1Dw8q98PQ,0.0,0.0

@StockyDude,"I didn’t vote for Trump because I liked him. He’s far from perfect. However, the Democrats were destroying the country. The economy and GDP grew but most working class Americans didn’t feel its benefits. It turns out that the number of new jobs created every month since 2021 has always been dwarfed by the sheer number of illegal immigrants that have entered the country (2 million per year in the past 4 years), which is why it hasn’t become easier for working class Americans to find a job. The construction of new homes cannot keep up with the influx of illegal immigrants either, which is why housing/rent costs keep going up. We need to close the border. Kamala won’t fix the border crisis. She lied at her CNN town hall. She’s not serious about border security or public safety at all. Check out the stats on illegal immigrants with criminal records. <br><br>From the CBP site: <br>FY 2017 (Trump’s first year in office) - 8,531 <br>FY 2018 - 6,698 <br>FY 2019 - 4,269 <br>FY 2020 - 2,438 <br><br>FY 2021 (Biden &amp; VP Harris’ first year in office) - 10,763<br> * Quadrupled from the year prior. <br>FY 2022 - 12,028 <br>FY 2023 - 15,267 <br>FY 2024 - 17,048 <br><br>Trump may be obnoxious, but we’re better off with an obnoxious president who can deliver improving results year after year instead of a friendly lady who makes things worse year after year.",Km1Dw8q98PQ,0.0,0.0

It’s abortion. Yes! ESPECIALLY FULL-TERM and it DOES happen. It’s like we live in a place where child sacrifice happens. IT’S THE UNVETTED OPEN BORDER. <br><br>Look, my core moral values and world view are who I am. It doesn’t agree with that of others out there. I’m not compromising on that. NEVER.

@vachelmcfarland4886,"Let&#39;s be clear... The Dems did not really lose the election.  The Repubs had groups across the USA, esp., True the Vote, who actively worked to disenfranchise legal voters of color by a policy of establishing the right of any (usually white) voter to challenge any other voter&#39;s (usually POC) right to cast a ballot, including those in the military who may be serving out of state.  The accused could only be re-enfranchised if they showed up at their local voters office to show documents that they are legal Americans.<br>However, many challenged voters were not alerted that their status had been challenged and therefore their votes were invalidated.<br>True the Vote did this in 48 states across the country.  It is estimated that thousands upon thousands of votes were not counted giving Trump the very slight edge over Harris.<br><br>Why no one is covering this on left wing media is shameful.",YUsuItpdOf4,0.0,2.0

@postulatingspin4470,"Black Men have gotten themselves well educated in current events, and history. The Democratic party was and still is the biggest threat to Democracy in our nation’s history. The Democratic party fought a war to keep their slaves, a war killing as many as 700,000 Americans in the process, and also killing the emancipator…. Lincoln, a Republican. This was the only real insurrection in the US. <br><br>Democrats owned substantially all the slaves save a few Indian tribes like the Cherokee. In northern cities like NYC, perhaps as many as 1 in 10 people were slaves….all owned by Democrats. Before and even long after the war and Lincoln’s emancipation orders, the Democratic party’s KKK persecuted, lynched, and murdered both Blacks and Jews. This is why I am always amazed that any Black or Jewish person takes sides with this party….can only be a case of Stockholm Syndrome, ignorance, or both. Democrats and the undereducated they prey upon are by far the most significant threat to Democracy. Biden, the leader of the Democratic Party, his self proclaimed mentor was Robert Byrd, an Exulted Grand Cyclops in the Democratic party’s KKK. Wake up people and get yourself an education about who the Democratic party was and still is today…just a sad collection of race baiters who shoot people they cannot win a debate with. Now ask yourself….why did so many black men leave the Democratic Plantation this election cycle? Maybe they took up history and current events?",YUsuItpdOf4,0.0,0.0

@wladekhanczar,"DEAR BROTHERS AND SISTERS, GOOD AMERICANS!<br><br>05.11.2024 Dear Americans, you have a celebration of democracy, the presidential election. You will choose between former California Attorney General Kamala Harris and notorious criminal Donald Trump. The character traits of a person, their honesty, decency, truthfulness, respect for people and good principles are also essential for respecting the Constitution, democracy, the rule of law. The 25-point program of the NSDAP presented by Hitler on 24.02.1920 reeked of hatred for democracy. What does Trump say? &quot; “I need the kind of generals that Hitler had,” “I will deal with the democrats, judges, prosecutors, Biden, Harris and others will be charged in court, every state that votes for Harris will not receive federal subsidies,” etc. Donald Trump is an unbalanced lunatic, mythomaniac, narcissist, liar, abuser, sexual predator, rapist, criminal supported by the KGB since 1976 when the STB (read: KGB) provided him with the Czech model Ivana Zelnickova. Since then, Trump has had a delicate &quot;brainwashing&quot;, Ivana Trump made him realize that strong leadership of the leader (dictatorship) is better than democracy, that communism is not that bad. For Donald Trump, the most important thing is money and his wealth. After bankruptcies, he rebuilt his business position several times with the KGB-FSB money, so that in 2013, after the Miss Universe competition in Moscow, he allowed himself to be recorded at the Ritz Hotel during a sexual orgy with underage girls.<br><br>Americans who vote for Trump in 2024 are voting for their own destruction, just like the Germans who voted for the NSDAP on March 5, 1933.<br><br>Dear Americans! In 1776, the Founding Fathers of the USA adopted the Declaration of Independence and in 1789 the Constitution, which defined the foundation of American democracy. By creating a democratic state of law guaranteeing civil rights and freedoms, you initiated modern democracy, which helped you create a global superpower over 136 years. It is thanks to the USA and your Constitution that the process of creating modern democratic states ruled by free citizens began in the world. This is the most beautiful evolution in human history. You, People of the USA, will choose your president on November 5, 2024, using the power given to you. Choose wisely, choose peace, goodness and love, understanding, cooperation, development and a good future for you and future generations. Vote for Vice President Kamala Harris! Do not choose war, evil, lies, aggression, violence and hypocrisy.<br><br>God save America from Donald Trump.",4F6GGZxcICE,0.0,0.0

@wladekhanczar,"DEAR BROTHERS AND SISTERS, GOOD AMERICANS!<br><br>05.11.2024 Dear Americans, you have a celebration of democracy, the presidential election. You will choose between former California Attorney General Kamala Harris and notorious criminal Donald Trump. The character traits of a person, their honesty, decency, truthfulness, respect for people and good principles are also essential for respecting the Constitution, democracy, the rule of law. The 25-point program of the NSDAP presented by Hitler on 24.02.1920 reeked of hatred for democracy. What does Trump say? &quot; “I need the kind of generals that Hitler had,” “I will deal with the democrats, judges, prosecutors, Biden, Harris and others will be charged in court, every state that votes for Harris will not receive federal subsidies,” etc. Donald Trump is an unbalanced lunatic, mythomaniac, narcissist, liar, abuser, sexual predator, rapist, criminal supported by the KGB since 1976 when the STB (read: KGB) provided him with the Czech model Ivana Zelnickova. Since then, Trump has had a delicate &quot;brainwashing&quot;, Ivana Trump made him realize that strong leadership of the leader (dictatorship) is better than democracy, that communism is not that bad. For Donald Trump, the most important thing is money and his wealth. After bankruptcies, he rebuilt his business position several times with the KGB-FSB money, so that in 2013, after the Miss Universe competition in Moscow, he allowed himself to be recorded at the Ritz Hotel during a sexual orgy with underage girls.<br><br>Americans who vote for Trump in 2024 are voting for their own destruction, just like the Germans who voted for the NSDAP on March 5, 1933.<br><br>Dear Americans! In 1776, the Founding Fathers of the USA adopted the Declaration of Independence and in 1789 the Constitution, which defined the foundation of American democracy. By creating a democratic state of law guaranteeing civil rights and freedoms, you initiated modern democracy, which helped you create a global superpower over 136 years. It is thanks to the USA and your Constitution that the process of creating modern democratic states ruled by free citizens began in the world. This is the most beautiful evolution in human history. You, People of the USA, will choose your president on November 5, 2024, using the power given to you. Choose wisely, choose peace, goodness and love, understanding, cooperation, development and a good future for you and future generations. Vote for Vice President Kamala Harris! Do not choose war, evil, lies, aggression, violence and hypocrisy.<br><br>God save America from Donald Trump.",Dx_AZo2Qciw,0.0,0.0

@journalistedisoncarter,"There is a sentence at the end of article 12 of the constitution. The last sentence. And that sentence reads....<br><br>&quot;But no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the Unites States.&quot;<br><br>That sentence is about position eligibility. But there&#39;s just this one thing.  The first HALF of that sentence when isolated says something interesting in implication. It says...<br><br>&quot;But no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible...&quot;<br><br>As i look at article 12 and wonder &quot;what the hell is Trump up to?&quot;, I think there is something more powerful. If a person is constitutionally ineligible to hold office; then they cannot be in office BECAUSE of some action and BECAUSE of the constitution. It&#39;s a double whammy. How? Well, if Donald Trump is going to suspend the constitution as he has said, he has already SAID he has more authority than the constitution (which is impossible because you cannot hold office if you do not uphold and swear an oath to the constitution). And thereby, in that logic, with Donald Trump having already been in office for a single term as a president that swore an oath to the constitution, has stated his intent to suspend the constitution and his oath. He has already betrayed his oath. The constitution itself forbids someone to hold office if constitutionally ineligible. He betrayed his oath. He threw it out. He promised to end the very document that makes all laws work, bind together, and give function to a system of laws and the rule of law that millions of men and women have sworn to uphold.<br><br>Tell me how someone is constitutionally eligible for office that has betrayed his oath and said the very thing one must swear to uphold need not exist?<br><br>And THAT&#39;S what Trump&#39;s up to. The end of a nation&#39;s constitution. Trump&#39;s law; not the law of a land.<br><br>Trump&#39;s twisted logic. It&#39;s a different operating system that is incompatible with the constitution. <br><br>Yup. I&#39;ve nailed it.

I like her personality. However, with a sense of loyalty and responsibility to the country, I carefully analyzed and compared the two candidates, and I chose Trump and Vance, believing they can unite our nation and its people, forgive political opponents, and lead the U.S. and the world through this crisis.

@StockyDude,"I’m an independent and I changed my mind on Kamala. I’m not voting for her after doing my own research. I tried to figure out why the economy and GDP grew but most working class Americans weren’t feeling its benefits. It turns out that the number of new jobs created every month since 2021 has always been dwarfed by the sheer number of illegal immigrants that have entered the country (2 million per year in the past 4 years), which is why it hasn’t become easier for working class folks to find a job. Also, the construction of new homes cannot keep up with the influx of illegal immigrants either, which is why housing/rent costs keep going up. We need to close the border. No matter how you empathize with the migrants, it’s obvious that over 2 million each year is just too much. <br><br>Kamala won’t fix the border crisis. She lied at her CNN town hall. She’s not serious about border security or public safety at all. Check out the stats on illegal immigrants with criminal records. <br><br>From the CBP site: <br>FY 2017 (Trump’s first year in office) - 8,531 <br>FY 2018 - 6,698 <br>FY 2019 - 4,269 <br>FY 2020 - 2,438 <br><br>FY 2021 (Biden &amp; VP Harris’ first year in office) - 10,763<br> * Quadrupled from the year prior. <br>FY 2022 - 12,028 <br>FY 2023 - 15,267 <br>FY 2024 - 17,048 <br><br>Trump may be obnoxious, but we’re better off with an obnoxious president who can deliver improving results year after year instead of a friendly lady who makes things worse year after year.",1PyoxwKgJyI,3.0,2.0
